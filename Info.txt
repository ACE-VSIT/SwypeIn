In this version of client side code

Only Messages are being sent to the Server
UI has almost no problems at all.

But application will always crash at first use. 

Like using first time after opening system and that
can be annoying

Also, I will have to publish changes in server code in order
to make this thing work

Still, keep it here for reference. Do NOT delete it assuming 
that you don't need it. That is unless you have understood 
SignalR and can make apps based on that on your own
